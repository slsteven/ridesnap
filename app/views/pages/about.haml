    %h2.purple{cite: "#{request.protocol}#{request.host}"} "By providing a door to door white glove service, #{Settings.app.name} brings the experience of owning a car full circle."
    %p For many people, owning a car means convenience to their life, but when it comes time to selling one, what was used as a time saver now becomes a hassle. #{Settings.app.name} wants to take this time consuming and stressful process out of the seller's hands and make it simple like it should be. #{Settings.app.name} is not a dealership, and does not buy cars to resell. Instead, #{Settings.app.name} does the selling for you through peer to peer marketplaces. By providing a door to door white glove service, #{Settings.app.name} brings the experience of owning a car full circle.
