    %h3 FOR SELLERS:
    %br
    %p.purple How do you determine the listing prices?
    %p LListing price is determined by a combination of data from KBB, Edmunds, Craigslist, and your location and the pre-purchase inspection.
    %br
    %p.purple What do I need to do?
    %p Just schedule an appointment to get your inspection so we can give you a final quote.  We handle the rest: posting your ads, finding buyers, scheduling test drives, etc.
    %br
    %p.purple What if I still need my car?
    %p No worries, keep using your car during the selling process. We work around your needs!
    %br
    %p.purple How do you schedule test drives?
    %p If you need to drive your car while we try to sell it, we will have to coordinate with your schedule. Otherwise, we will meet your buyers without bothering you.
    %br
    %p.purple How do I save more money than a dealership?
    %p Going to a dealership for a trade-in they usually under value your car by 10-20% so they can resell it to make a larger profit. Because RideSnap does not buy your car, we never mark it down for our own profit. We are on the same team!
